## Introduction

This project aims to predict the presence of heart disease in patients based on various clinical and demographic factors. It uses the Cleveland Heart Disease dataset from the UCI repository and employs machine learning algorithms for prediction. The goal is to help healthcare professionals make informed decisions and improve patient outcomes.

## Dataset

The dataset contains 303 individualsâ€™ data with 14 columns, including demographic and clinical features such as age, gender, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels. The target variable is the presence or absence of heart disease.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The EDA process involves analyzing the dataset to gain insights and identify patterns that can help in building the prediction model. It includes data visualization, data cleaning, and feature engineering.

## Prediction

The prediction process involves building a machine learning model to predict the presence of heart disease in patients. It includes model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation.
